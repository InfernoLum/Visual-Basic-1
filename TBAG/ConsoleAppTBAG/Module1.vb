Isn't the definision of life bias and filled with the subjectivity of society? Maby life is a refference to the social state of someone or their connection to other people. But what if what's important to you isn't other people but something else entierly... what if you seeked reason instead of acceptance, what if you seeked rasional thinking and efficiency in exchanging information. Then most of what we call communication is irrelevant and if it is then the deffinision of life is irrelevant too. And that's not the end of it, there are so many commonly accepted ideas that rely of a social norm that not everyone agrees with or understands.
